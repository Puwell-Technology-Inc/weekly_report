# Work Summary:

## 1. Image Colorization

### Reference-based Colorization: First Demo on Mobile

- **Model**: Reference-based Colorization ConvNeXt UInt8
- **Device**: Redmi K70 Pro
- **Framework:** Onnx Runtime
- **Inference Time**: 420ms/frame, 7s for 150 frames (with Transfer Color)
- **Memory Usage**: 370MB for image, 480MB for video

**Some Results:** from top to bottom: Input grayscale, Day background as a reference → Colorized result

**Some Notes:**

- Preprocessing & Postprocessing are integrated into ONNX model to simplify the process. Inputs and Outputs all in RGB.
- Guided Filter damages the Colorization quality → good for Low Light Enhancement but not for Colorization → replace Guided Filter by Color Transfer, trade-offs: might causes color bleeding for moving objects, but since it is for background enhancement, I think it is acceptable for now.
- The inference time is relatively high even after quantization → this can be improved later.
- Color Blending is not yet available on mobile → next week work plan.

**Next Step:**

- Continue working on the demo and prepare for the next phase.

### Fine-tuned Model:

Wait for the latest Pipeline Alignment

**Perspective:**

- Fine-Tune Post-Processing for Noise Types
    - Given that baby-related and low-amplitude noises are significant sources of FAR,  applying **post-processing filters** that reduce sensitivity specifically for these noise categories.
- Consider Higher Precision
    - **4-bit quantization** may be too aggressive, leading to loss of important information and increasing FAR. Using **8-bit quantization** instead can help retain more precision and potentially provide a more reliable balance between Sensibility and FAR in case that 4-bit model is still too overfitting after fine tuning parameters
        
        **→ Can’t be inferenced on the T31 board**
