# Work Summary:

## 1. Image Colorization

### Train DDColor on the new dataset

- Training dataset: 110449 day images (first and last frame cut from every video in /home/share/datasets/cloud, filter out grayscale images)
- Some results:

- Comment:
    - After training the model with our dataset, it performs better in some areas where the original model struggled.
    - However, it still has issues like color bleeding and fails in many cases.
    - Overall, the result is not as impressive compared to the pretrained DDColor model.

### DeepRemaster: Temporal Source-Reference Attention Networks for Comprehensive Video Enhancement (SIGGRAPH Asia 2019)

The model was trained to perform denoising/restoration and colorization as the same time.

- **Input**: one noisy, grayscale video to be enhanced and many reference images.
- **Output**: a denoised, color video.
- **Some results**:

Result (left: input grayscale - right: DeepRemaster result)

- **Comment**: The model failed to generate the color.

### Issue:

## 2. Infant Crying Detection

### Working on Magik-toolkit_t31.zip

- Retest the examples for fixing the bug “can’t convert to magik file for T31 board”
- Summary the hangover from LE’s colorization task
- Select other models which are compatible to current library

### Select new model (MobileNetV2)

- Train new float model 32bit (MobileNetV2) which compatible to current library
