# Work Summary:

## 1. Image Colorization

### Reducing Color Inconsistency

Automatic Colorization works well for static video. However, when there are moving objects, high level of noise, encoding artifacts,… the models gives different color between frames.

**Solution:** Applying a ‘relaxed’ background extraction for the colorization model.

- The purpose is to reduce the changes between video frames → reduce color inconsistency.
- but also taking into the changes for colorization → update the content of the frame.

Inspired by the idea of Exponential Moving Average, I propose using a simpler Accumulate Weighted function for video background extraction.

$$
background_{t} = \alpha * frame_{t} + (1-\alpha) * background_{t-1}
$$

This also helps partially reducing color residue.

**Metric**:

- Sensitivity: 95.06

- FAR: 12.12

- Miss Rate: 4.94

**Perspective:**

- Fine-Tune the model of expected metric:
    - Sensitivity > 90%
    - Miss Rate < 10%
    - FAR ~ 5%
- Collaborate with the embedded team for deploying model on the board T32

## 3. Infant Rollover Detection:

Current Pipeline: 

- Input: Frame
- Output: Rollover signal

Frame → Detection layer → Pose estimation layer → get hips, shoulders, and nose → calculate rotation angle of infant and track shoulders movement → Detect Rollover at infants. 

This pipeline is based on research of this paper ([Link](https://www.ams.giti.waseda.ac.jp/data/pdf-files/2020_GCCE_okuno.pdf))

Demo video: 

- [Demo video 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MRqf3j-n1CVbyo4e3vLwakwxEdp8mCVf/view?usp=sharing)
- [Demo video 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a9tEiX8zvdmeP2EBKSzvPx4PEAX-uP32/view?usp=sharing)
- [Demo video 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WPD7nKXplGxexSf5HBya8jDdZeHFXJY9/view?usp=sharing)

Successfully developed a simple pipeline for the project, but there are some pros of this solution:

- The noise when tracking the shoulders of infants makes the prediction wrong

→ Next week, research more for another pipeline to back up.
